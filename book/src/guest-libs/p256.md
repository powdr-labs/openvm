# P256

The P256 guest library uses [`openvm-ecc-guest`](../custom-extensions/ecc.md) to provide elliptic curve operations over the Secp256r1 curve. It is intended as a patch for the [`p256`](https://crates.io/crates/p256) rust crate and can be swapped in for accelerated signature verification usage. Note that signing from a private key is not supported.  


### Config parameters

For the guest program to build successfully, all used moduli and curves must be declared in the `.toml` config file in the following format:

```toml
[app_vm_config.modular]
supported_moduli = ["115792089210356248762697446949407573530086143415290314195533631308867097853951", "115792089210356248762697446949407573529996955224135760342422259061068512044369"]

[[app_vm_config.ecc.supported_curves]]
struct_name = "P256Point"
modulus = "115792089210356248762697446949407573530086143415290314195533631308867097853951"
scalar = "115792089210356248762697446949407573529996955224135760342422259061068512044369"
a = "115792089210356248762697446949407573530086143415290314195533631308867097853948"
b = "41058363725152142129326129780047268409114441015993725554835256314039467401291"
```

The `supported_moduli` parameter is a list of moduli that the guest program will use. As mentioned in the [algebra extension](../custom-extensions/algebra.md) chapter, the order of moduli in `[app_vm_config.modular]` must match the order in the `moduli_init!` macro.

The `ecc.supported_curves` parameter is a list of supported curves that the guest program will use. They must be provided in decimal format in the `.toml` file. For multiple curves create multiple `[[app_vm_config.ecc.supported_curves]]` sections. The order of curves in `[[app_vm_config.ecc.supported_curves]]` must match the order in the `sw_init!` macro.
Also, the `struct_name` field must be the name of the elliptic curve struct created by `sw_declare!`.
