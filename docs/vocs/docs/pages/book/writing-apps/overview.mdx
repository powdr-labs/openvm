# Overview of Basic Usage

## Writing a Program

The first step to using OpenVM is to write a Rust program that can be executed by an OpenVM virtual machine. Writing a program for OpenVM is very similar to writing a standard Rust program, with a few key differences necessary to support the OpenVM environment. For more detailed information about writing programs, see the [Writing a Program](/book/writing-apps/writing-a-program) guide.

## Building and Transpiling a Program

At this point, you should have a guest program with a `Cargo.toml` file in the root of your project directory. What's next?

The first thing you will want to do is build and transpile your program using the following command:

```bash
cargo openvm build
```

By default this will build the project located in the current directory. Once you have built the program,
you can generate commitments to the program binary and VM configuration using the following command:

```bash
cargo openvm commit
```

To execute the program, you can run the following command:

```bash
cargo openvm run --input <path_to_input | hex_string>
```

Note if your program doesn't require inputs, you can omit the `--input` flag.

For more information see the [build](/book/writing-apps/compiling-a-program) and [run](/book/writing-apps/running-a-program) docs.

### Inputs

The `--input` field needs to either be a single hex string or a file path to a json file that contains the key `input` and an array of hex strings. Also note that if you need to provide multiple input streams, you have to use the file path option.
Each hex string (either in the file or as the direct input) is either:

- Hex string of bytes, which is prefixed with `0x01`
- Hex string of native field elements (represented as u32, little endian), prefixed with `0x02`

If you are providing input for a struct of type `T` that will be deserialized by the `openvm::io::read()` function, then the corresponding hex string should be prefixed by `0x01` followed by the serialization of `T` into bytes according to `openvm::serde::to_vec`. The serialization will serialize primitive types (e.g., `u8, u16, u32, u64`) into little-endian bytes. All serialized bytes are zero-padded to a multiple of `4` byte length.

:::note
The hex string must be of an even length. The reason for this is to avoid ambiguity: for example, if `12c` is passed, it is unclear whether it is supposed to be `012c`, `120c` or anything else.
:::

As an example, the code snippet below generates an input json file from a struct of type `T`:
```rust
use std::{fs, path::PathBuf};
use std::error::Error;

fn encode_input_file<T>(value: &T, path: PathBuf) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>>
where
    T: serde::Serialize + ?Sized,
{
  let words = openvm::serde::to_vec(value)?;
  let bytes: Vec<u8> = words
      .into_iter()
      .flat_map(|w| w.to_le_bytes())
      .collect();
  let hex_bytes = String::from("0x01") + &hex::encode(&bytes);
  let input = serde_json::json!({
      "input": [hex_bytes]
  });
  fs::write(path, serde_json::to_string(&input)?)?;
  Ok(())
}
```

For more details on how to serialize complex types into a VM-readable format, see the input utilities in the [OpenVM example program](https://github.com/openvm-org/openvm-example-fibonacci/).

## Generating Application Proofs

To generate a proof, you first need to generate a proving and verifying key for the OpenVM configuration
used by the program. This depends only on the configuration specified in `openvm.toml` and is done by the
following command:

```bash
cargo openvm keygen
```

See the [custom extensions](/book/acceleration-using-extensions/overview) docs for more information about `openvm.toml`. After generating the keys, you can generate a proof by running:

```bash
cargo openvm prove app --input <path_to_input | hex_string>
```

Again, if your program doesn't require inputs, you can omit the `--input` flag. For more information
on the `keygen` and `prove` commands, see the [prove](/book/writing-apps/generating-proofs) doc.

## Verifying Application Proofs

To verify a proof using the CLI, you need to provide the verifying key and the proof.

```bash
cargo openvm verify app
```

For more information on the `verify` command, see the [verify](/book/writing-apps/verifying-proofs) doc.

## STARK and EVM Proof Generation and Verification

The process above details the workflow necessary to build, prove, and verify a guest program at
the application level. As described in the [specs](/specs/architecture/continuations), OpenVM supports
proof aggregation into a single STARK proof or an EVM proof. Performing this aggregation requires
key generation for the aggregation proving keys and the EVM verifier contract, which is done by:

```bash
cargo openvm setup [--evm]
```

This will write the files necessary for STARK aggregation and EVM proving to `~/.openvm/`.

:::warning
This command requires a large amount of compute and memory (~70 GB).
:::

To generate and verify aggregated STARK or EVM proofs, you can run the following commands:

```bash
cargo openvm prove <stark | evm> --input <path_to_input | hex_string>
cargo openvm verify <stark | evm>
```

For more information on the `prove` and `verify` commands, see the [prove](/book/writing-apps/generating-proofs) and [verify](/book/writing-apps/verifying-proofs) docs.
