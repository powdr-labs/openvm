# Compiling a Program

Once you have written a program to be proven by OpenVM, you need to compile it in a way
which is compatible with OpenVM. We refer to programs written to be proven by OpenVM as 
**guest programs**, with the term coming from its usage in 
[cross-compilation](/specs/reference/rust-frontend) as explained in the specs.

## Building Guest Programs for OpenVM

To prove a guest program in OpenVM, we must build it for a RISC-V guest target and then transpile
it to a format natively supported by OpenVM.  We provide the following CLI command to do this:

```bash
cargo openvm build
```

The presently supported guest target is `riscv32im-risc0-zkvm-elf` due to its official support by
the [Rust toolchain](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/platform-support/riscv32im-risc0-zkvm-elf.html).
We anticipate upstreaming an OpenVM-specific target to Rust in the future. More details about
how cross-compilation works in Rust can be found in the [Rust docs](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/cross-compilation.html). 

## Build Flags

The following flags are available for the `cargo openvm build` command. You can run `cargo openvm build --help` for this list within the command line.

Generally, outputs will always be built to the **target directory**, which will either be determined by the manifest path or explicitly set using the `--target-dir` option. By default Cargo sets this to be `<workspace_or_package_root>/target/`. 

OpenVM-specific artifacts will be placed in `${target_dir}/openvm/`, but if `--output-dir` is specified they will be copied to `${output-dir}/` as well.

### OpenVM Options

- `--no-transpile`

  **Description**: Skips transpilation into an OpenVM-compatible `.vmexe` executable when set.

- `--config <CONFIG>`

  **Description**: Path to the OpenVM config `.toml` file that specifies the VM extensions. By default will search the manifest directory for `openvm.toml`. If no file is found, OpenVM will use a default configuration. Currently the CLI only supports known extensions listed in the [Acceleration Using Pre-Built Extensions](/book/acceleration-using-extensions/overview) section. To use other extensions, use the [SDK](/book/advanced-usage/sdk).

- `--output-dir <OUTPUT_DIR>`

  **Description**: Output directory for OpenVM artifacts to be copied to.

- `--init-file-name <INIT_FILE_NAME>`

  **Description**: Name of the generated initialization file, which will be written into the manifest directory.

  **Default**: `openvm_init.rs`

### Package Selection

As with `cargo build`, default package selection depends on the working directory. If the working directory is a subdirectory of a specific package, then only that package will be built. Else, all packages in the workspace will be built by default.

- `--package <PACKAGES>`

  **Description**: Builds only the specified packages. This flag may be specified multiple times or as a comma-separated list.

- `--workspace`

  **Description**: Builds all members of the workspace (alias `--all`).

- `--exclude <PACKAGES>`

  **Description**: Excludes the specified packages. Must be used in conjunction with `--workspace`. This flag may be specified multiple times or as a comma-separated list.

### Target Selection

By default all package libraries and binaries will be built. To build samples or demos under the `examples` directory, use either the `--example` or `--examples` option.

- `--lib`

  **Description**: Builds the package's library.

- `--bin <BIN>`

  **Description**: Builds the specified binary. This flag may be specified multiple times or as a comma-separated list.

- `--bins`

  **Description**: Builds all binary targets.

- `--example <EXAMPLE>`

  **Description**: Builds the specified example. This flag may be specified multiple times or as a comma-separated list.

- `--examples`

  **Description**: Builds all example targets.

- `--all-targets`

  **Description**: Builds all package targets. Equivalent to specifying `--lib` `--bins` `--examples`.

### Feature Selection

The following options enable or disable conditional compilation features defined in your `Cargo.toml`.

- `-F`, `--features <FEATURES>`

  **Description**: Space or comma separated list of features to activate. Features of workspace members may be enabled with `package-name/feature-name` syntax. This flag may also be specified multiple times.

- `--all-features`

  **Description**: Activates all available features of all selected packages.

- `--no-default-features`

  **Description**: Do not activate the `default` feature of the selected packages.

### Compilation Options

- `--profile <NAME>`

  **Description**: Builds with the given profile. Common profiles are `dev` (faster builds, less optimization) and `release` (slower builds, more optimization). For more information on profiles, see [Cargo's reference page](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html).

  **Default**: `release`

### Output Options

- `--target-dir <TARGET_DIR>`

  **Description**: Directory for all generated artifacts and intermediate files. Defaults to directory `target/` at the root of the workspace.

### Display Options

- `-v`, `--verbose`

  **Description**: Use verbose output.

- `-q`, `--quiet`

  **Description**: Do not print Cargo log messages.

- `--color <WHEN>`

  **Description**: Controls when colored output is used.

  **Default**: `always`

### Manifest Options

- `--manifest-path <PATH>`

  **Description**: Path to the guest code Cargo.toml file. By default, `build` searches for the file in the current or any parent directory. The `build` command will be executed in that directory.

- `--ignore-rust-version`

  **Description**: Ignores rust-version specification in packages.

- `--locked`

  **Description**: Asserts the same dependencies and versions are used as when the existing Cargo.lock file was originally generated.

- `--offline`

  **Description**: Prevents Cargo from accessing the network for any reason.

- `--frozen`

  **Description**: Equivalent to specifying both `--locked` and `--offline`.
